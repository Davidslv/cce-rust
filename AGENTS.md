# AGENTS.md

Instructions for an AI agent working in the **cce-rust** repository. Follow these
alongside [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md); this file is the agent-oriented
summary.

## What this project is

`cce` is a local CLI that indexes a code repository (tree-sitter AST chunking →
embedding → JSON vector + BM25 index) and answers queries with hybrid retrieval.
It is a **test-first implementation of [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) v1.0**, the **Dashboard
addendum [`DASHBOARD-SPEC.md`](DASHBOARD-SPEC.md) (v1.1)**, and the **v2.0
language-packs evolution [`SPEC-V2.md`](SPEC-V2.md)**. All three specs are the
single source of truth for behaviour — treat them as the constitution. A sibling
Ruby implementation ([davidslv/cce-ruby](https://github.com/davidslv/cce-ruby)) is
built from the identical specs, and the two must stay conformance-compatible —
including the dashboard aggregator's §4.1 anchor and the v2 chunk conformance over
`test/fixture/samples`.

**Language support is pluggable packs (SPEC-V2).** The core chunker/importer
(`src/chunker.rs`) references **no language by name** — a guard test enforces this
(`tests/language_packs.rs`). Each language is one file under `src/packs/`
implementing the `LanguagePack` trait, registered in `default_registry()`, and
guarded by three validator layers (`cce packs --validate`). To add a language,
follow [`docs/adding-a-language.md`](docs/adding-a-language.md); do **not** add
language-specific code or comments to the core. Every chunk carries a `kind` (the
exact tree-sitter node type) alongside the coarse `chunk_type`.

**The metrics/dashboard subsystem is the one place wall-clock time and unique
IDs are allowed** (`src/metrics.rs`, `src/aggregator.rs`, `src/dashboard.rs`).
Everywhere else stays deterministic. In metrics, the clock and id source are
**injected** so tests pin them; the aggregator is a **pure function** of
`(events, now, price)` with no ambient time. Keep it that way. The metrics schema
grows **only additively** — the reader tolerates absent/unknown fields (v2.4.1 added
`search.source`, `index.{sha,source,sensitive_skipped}`, and the `by_source` /
`secret_safety` / `index_freshness` aggregate sections), so older logs still parse and
both engines stay in parity. Every `/api/metrics` panel is a **pure function of the
log**, so the **dashboard makes zero network calls** — `index_freshness` carries no
`remote_latest`/`behind_remote`; a live behind-remote comparison lives only in
`cce sync status` and MCP `index_status`.

## The gates that must stay green

Before you consider any change done, all three must pass — CI runs exactly these:

```bash
cargo test                                                  # tests pass
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings    # zero warnings
cargo fmt --check                                           # formatting matches
```

- Do **not** disable, weaken, or `#[allow(...)]`-around a clippy warning to make
  the gate pass; fix the underlying cause. A narrowly-scoped allow with a written
  reason is acceptable only when genuinely warranted.
- `rustfmt.toml` is the **house style** (compact: `use_small_heuristics = "Max"`,
  imports and modules not reordered). Run `cargo fmt`; never hand-format around
  it.

## TDD discipline

This codebase is built test-first (see [`docs/TDD.md`](docs/TDD.md)):

1. Write a **failing test** for the new behaviour first.
2. Add the minimum code to make it pass.
3. Refactor with tests green.

Tests must be **deterministic and hermetic** — no network, no wall-clock, no
ambient filesystem state. The only test needing a real server (live Ollama) is
`#[ignore]`; the Ollama failure-policy tests run against a **loopback HTTP stub**
(via `CCE_OLLAMA_URL`) or a closed local port, never a real server.
The metrics tests inject a fixed clock/id source, and the dashboard's socket test
binds an **ephemeral loopback port** and serves a bounded number of connections.
Keep coverage at or above the baseline (**660 tests, ~94% line coverage** via
`cargo llvm-cov`); a change that lowers coverage should add tests. The CI test
gate also runs the three-layer validators over every language pack.

## Spec conformance must not drift

`cce conformance test/fixture/samples` produces a byte-stable
[`conformance.json`](conformance.json) (v2 shape: each chunk carries `kind`, no
queries section) that is designed to match the Ruby sibling on the byte-identical
samples. **Do not change this output as a side effect** — and do not edit the
`test/fixture/samples/` files (the cross-language gate depends on byte equality). If a change legitimately
alters it, that is a deliberate, spec-level act: justify it against `SPEC.md`,
call it out explicitly in the PR, and note that the Ruby sibling may need a
matching change. Preserve the determinism rules (6-decimal
round-half-away-from-zero, `chunk_id` ascending tie-break; SPEC §5.3) everywhere
scores are compared, sorted, or emitted.

## Where things live (docs map)

- [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) — normative base-engine behaviour reference (authoritative).
- [`DASHBOARD-SPEC.md`](DASHBOARD-SPEC.md) — normative dashboard/observability
  addendum (v1.1); wins over `SPEC.md` for the metrics feature only.
- [`SPEC-V2.md`](SPEC-V2.md) — the v2.0 language-packs evolution (packs, registry,
  validators, `kind`, conformance shape); wins over `SPEC.md` for chunking/packs.
- [`SPEC-V2.1.md`](SPEC-V2.1.md) · [`SPEC-V2.2.md`](SPEC-V2.2.md) ·
  [`SPEC-SYNC.md`](SPEC-SYNC.md) · [`SPEC-MCP.md`](SPEC-MCP.md) ·
  [`SPEC-V2.5-SAVINGS.md`](SPEC-V2.5-SAVINGS.md) — the secret-protection (v2.1),
  workspace (v2.2), CCE Sync (v2.3), CCE MCP (v2.4), and Savings Layers (v2.5)
  evolution specs; each wins over `SPEC.md` for its feature. `cce mcp`/`cce init` and
  the **nine MCP tools** (`context_search`, `index_status`, `record_feedback`,
  `expand_chunk`, `related_context`, `set_output_compression`, `record_decision`,
  `session_recall`, `summarize_context`, in that fixed `tools/list` order) live in
  `src/mcp/`; their names/schemas/output and the byte-pinned descriptions are a
  **cross-language contract** with the Ruby engine — do not drift them. The v2.5
  transforms (compact chunks, output/grammar/memory/summary blocks, the ledger) are
  deterministic and byte-pinned; cce-rust is the reference the Ruby engine catches up
  to. `SYNC_FORMAT_VERSION` stays `2.3` (decoupled from the app version); v2.5 does
  not change `conformance.json` or the Sync artifact. **v2.6 (Knowledge Sources)**
  adds `src/markdown.rs` + `src/knowledge/` (`cce knowledge index`, the
  `cce.knowledge/v1` contract, the `source: code|knowledge|both` blend on
  `context_search` — still nine tools) and the committed-`.gitignore`-aware walk in
  `src/walker.rs`; all fully additive — `conformance.json` and the Sync artifact
  stay byte-identical. The **Sync consumer mode** (#53–#55: `cce sync list`,
  `cce sync pull --all` with the synthesized `store-only` member type, the
  published workspace metadata at additive well-known cache keys, and
  `cce sync verify --checksum-only` against the `installed_sha256` recorded in
  `.cce/synced.json`) is likewise fully additive — `SYNC_FORMAT_VERSION` stays
  `2.3` and every existing golden is untouched.

## Commit and PR conventions

- Focused commits, imperative subject lines; conventional-commit prefixes
  (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`) are encouraged.
- One concern per PR; reference the issue it closes.
- Fill in [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) —
  it is the checklist of the gates above, including the conformance question.
- For anything beyond a small, obvious fix, open an issue first.

## Do not

- Do not commit or push unless explicitly asked.
- Do not add dependencies without discussion (they are pinned in `Cargo.toml`);
  the only ecosystems here are cargo and github-actions.
- Do not introduce network calls into the default code path — offline-by-default
  is a design invariant. The Ollama embedder is the sole, opt-in exception.
- Do not read or copy from any other implementation of this spec (clean-room).
